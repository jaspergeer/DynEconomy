# DynEconomy
This is a Spigot plugin I built for a Towny/Economy server that I thought I'd share. It adds a level of depth to the economic simulation by putting a soft cap on the amount of money players can create and making Towny into a dedicated money sink.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Spigot 1.16
* TheNewEconomy
* Towny
* Vault

Tested on Spigot 1.16

Manage the flow of money in and our of your server's economy!
Designate what items can be sold to the server and adjust inflation rates to limit how much money can be created!
