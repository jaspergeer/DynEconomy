# DynEconomy
This is a Minecraft Spigot plugin I built for a Towny/Economy server that I thought I'd share. It adds a level of depth to the economic simulation by putting a soft cap on the amount of money players can create through dynamically adjusting the price of a chosen "currency item" in a way that the market cap approaches a specified value.
